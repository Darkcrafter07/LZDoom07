---=== LZDoom07 Camera Glow Light Effect ===---

The main purpose is to attach a dynamic light on to a player
so that Doom Software Renderer camera glow alike effect becomes
possible even on OpenGL1 video cards.

kept available for all modes since it may improve visibility.
But MAKE SURE it looks the best in GL1/GL2 modes ONLY.

I give NO warranties and NO responsibility for ANY POSSIBLE DAMAGE!
